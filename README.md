# Neighborhood Project

This project is the final project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree, an interactive Neighborhood Map programmed with React. One day I want to move to USA and Austin, Texas seems quite a good choice, you're welcome to explore its sights and places with me!

## Installation and Running the Project

To install and use the project:

* **Zip-Download:** Download the repository as a zip-file, extract it, use Git Bash to change
into the project directory.
* **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository with Git Bash to your machine with: ```git clone https://github.com/1Bugivugi/Udacity-Neighbourhood-Map/```.
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* ater running `npm start`, the React App should open automatically in your browser. If it doesn't, open `localhost:3000` in your Browser.
* **Service-Workers** only work in build-mode, not in the dev-mode. Run `npm run build` to build the app.

## Future Updates

More features to come soon! I'm planning to add more details about the places, let YOU ADD YOUR places and few other functionalities.

## Dependencies

* The map is provided by [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/)
* The data for the markers and popups comes from the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)
* [AXIOS](https://github.com/axios/axios) is used for fetching the data from the Foursquare.
* External library [React burger menu](https://github.com/negomi/react-burger-menu) is used for the SideBar component.

## Credits

* The [Udacity React lessons about controlled components](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd001/parts/c3e7b0d6-ffef-4421-b5fc-6df10fd0a1ae/modules/82766b2b-1870-4904-aa90-8ccbe63928c5/lessons/14331e60-a548-4cfb-a326-054545da8927/concepts/fc3f11d3-8779-4d8a-8a23-1cd782f8ddf3) helped me to implement the basic version of the search function.
* [Yayha Elharony's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywdxLNjhBYw&list=PLgOB68PvvmWCGNn8UMTpcfQEiITzxEEA1) helped me to set up my project with a combination of vanilla JavaScript and React.
* Along this journey The Turtle Squad gave me the power and the help needed to go on when I thought that I couldn't make it any more.
* Big thanks to the Udacity team for all their positivity and support!
* Also huge regards to a few fellow students who helped me along the way, no way I could've finished this course without them.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is my project as a Udacity student. I am planning to work on the project and to update it in the future to document how my programming skills grow and develop. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
